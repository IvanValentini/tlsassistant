In particular, by repeatedly requesting a session renegotiation, the attacker is able to saturate the server's resources resulting in a Denial-of-Service.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>Update the TLS library to a version that allows renegotiation disabling (e.g. OpenSSL v1.1.1+).</Textual>
