	<CVE>2011-1473</CVE>
	<CWE>264</CWE>
	<CVSS2>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P</CVSS2>
	<Description>Due to an incorrect handling of the Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation mechanism, an attacker is able to compromise the availability of the service. In particular, by repeatedly requesting a session renegotiation, the attacker is able to saturate the server's resources resulting in a Denial-of-Service.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>Update the TLS library to a version that allows renegotiation disabling (e.g. OpenSSL v1.1.1+)</Textual>
