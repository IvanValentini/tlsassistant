	<Description>This algorithms are deprecated, broken and/or not used anymore for security reasons. </Description>

		<Textual>You should check if they are used to encrypt something very important and eventually change them.
            If the algorithms are used to HASH something, you should check if the entropy is strong enough: for example, 128
            bit MD5 is too weak and someone could be using a Birthday Attack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack).

            If in doubt, change them with a stronger algorithm (like sha256).
