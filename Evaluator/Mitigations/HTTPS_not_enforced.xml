	<Description>If HTTPS is not enforced, a client may be tricked into visiting the unsecure (HTTP) version of a website. This would allow an attacker to read and manipulate his messages.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>For each HTTP connection the server must send a response containing: 
1. a permanent redirect (i.e. `301 Moved Permanently`);
2. a `Location` field indicating the proper URI to connect to (hostname preceded by *https://*).</Textual>
		<Snippet>
			<apache>1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);
2. find the VirtualHost that handles the connections to port 80 (it starts with `&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;`);
3. add the string `Redirect / https://website` where "website" is the URL you want to point the users to (e.g. www.fbk.eu).

N.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart`.</apache>
<nginx>1. In a default situation, you can edit your website configuration */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*
	(if you changed your site conf name */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/YOURSITECONFIGURATION*);
2. add 
	
		server {
    	listen 80 default_server;
    	server_name _;
    	return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
		}
3. remove ALL other `listen 80` inside `server{...}` brackets (except for the previous one)


N.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service nginx restart`.
