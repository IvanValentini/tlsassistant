	<Description>If HTTPS is not enforced, a client may be tricked into visiting the unsecure (HTTP) version of a website. This would allow an attacker to read and manipulate his messages.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>For each HTTP connection the server must send a response containing: 
1. a permanent redirect (i.e. `301 Moved Permanently`);
2. a `Location` field indicating the proper URI to connect to (hostname preceded by *https://*).</Textual>
