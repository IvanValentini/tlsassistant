	<ExtendedName>Triple Handshake Attack</ExtendedName>
	<CVE>Library dependent</CVE>
	<CVSS3>Library dependent</CVSS3>
	<Description>Due to the incorrect handling of the session identifier, an attacker is able to force two sessions to have the same `Master Secret` and ID. The attacker performs 3SHAKE by providing a server to which the victim deliberately connects. Once connected, the malicious server exploits the renegotiation mechanism to manipulate the session.
The attack leads to a client impersonation that, by breaking both confidentiality and authentication, has a serious impact on the transmission.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>The only acceptable mitigation is to use the `extended_master_secret` TLS extension. For this reason it is recommended to update the TLS library to a version that supports the aforementioned extension (e.g. OpenSSL v1.1.0+).</Textual>
