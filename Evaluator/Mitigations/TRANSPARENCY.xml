	<Description> With the current configuration, if a CA misissues a valid certificate for this domain, it may take months before being detected. Certificate transparency helps by reducing the interval between detection and mitigation.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>Use one of the following SCT delivery methods:
1. use a CA that embeds the SCT within the certificate;
2. embed it within a stapled OCSP response;
3. delivery it using a TLS Extension.
</Textual>
		<Snippet>
			<Apache>1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);

2. add the following lines: 
   ```bash
   SSLUseStapling on
   SSLStaplingResponderTimeout 5
   SSLStaplingReturnResponderErrors off
   SSLStaplingCache shmcb:/var/run/ocsp(128000)
   ```

N.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart` and make sure that your certificate has been logged (check at [crt.sh](https://crt.sh)).</Apache>
