	<Description> With the current configuration, if a CA misissues a valid certificate for this domain, it may take months before being detected. Certificate transparency helps by reducing the interval between detection and mitigation.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>Use one of the following SCT delivery methods:
1. use a CA that embeds the SCT within the certificate;
2. embed it within a stapled OCSP response;
3. delivery it using a TLS Extension.
.</Textual>
		<Snippet>
			<apache>1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);
2. add the following lines: 
    - SSLUseStapling on
    - SSLStaplingResponderTimeout 5
    - SSLStaplingReturnResponderErrors off
    - SSLStaplingCache shmcb:/var/run/ocsp(128000)

N.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart` and make sure that your certificate has been logged (check at [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) ).</apache>
			<nginx>In a default situation, you can edit your website configuration */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*
	(if you changed your site conf name */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/YOURSITECONFIGURATION*);
	
1. Add the following to your server configuration:
	ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:5m;

  	ssl_session_timeout 5m;
	
	ssl_stapling on;
  	
	ssl_stapling_verify on;
	
2. Restart your server with `sudo service nginx restart` and make sure that your certificate has been logged (check at [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) ).
