        <Mitigation>
            <Textual>You probabily have an hardcoded certificate or keystore. You should obfuscate it and properly encrypt it so nobody can use it if a decompilation is done. A strong and secure password should be sufficient.
                    Another mitigation should be dynamically downloading the certificate while runtime, from a trusted source, using a secure channel.
