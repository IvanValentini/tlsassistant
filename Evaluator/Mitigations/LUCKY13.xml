	<CVSS2>2.6</CVSS2> <!-- AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N -->
	<Description>By exploiting the structure of the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, an attacker can infer the content of a transmission. The attack is performed by capturing, tampering (actually damaging) and re-transmitting the messages sent by the client to see how the server responds.
The attack, by breaching in the authentication mechanism, has a serious impact on the transmission.</Description> 
	<Mitigation>
		<Textual>Update the TLS library to a version that contains the custom mitigations (e.g. OpenSSL v1.0.2h+).</Textual>
		<Snippet>
			<apache>No snippet available</apache>
			<nginx>The best mitigation is to update the OpenSSL libraries. The fastest mitigation is to disable all CBC ciphers.

1. In a default situation, you can edit your website configuration */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*
	(if you changed your site conf name */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/YOURSITECONFIGURATION*);
2. Inside `server {...}` brackets configuration, find `ssl_ciphers`;
3. Remove any CBC-related cipher (even nested one).


N.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service nginx restart`.
