      "Description": "By exploiting the key derivation performed by RSA during the handshake, an attacker that gained access to the server's private key can calculate the Master Secret for each session ever created. By doing so, it will be able to decrypt all the information exchanged between the server and any client within the key' interval of use (i.e current, past and even future captured transmissions).",
      "Mitigation": {
        "Textual": "Remove, from the list of the available cipher suites, the ones that use RSA as a key exchange algorithm",
