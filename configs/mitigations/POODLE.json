    "Description": "By exploiting the missing validation of the padding bytes during decryption, an attacker is able to guess the session cookie. The attack is mounted by performing a MITM and requesting a SSLv3 connection between the client and the server. Once accepted, the attack is performed by modifying the padding in order to guess the cookie.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "Disable SSLv3 protocol support.",
      "Snippet": {
        "apache": "1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);\n2. search for the line starting with: **SSLProtocol**\n   - if it contains the substring `+SSLv3`, remove it;\n   - otherwise, add `-SSLv3` at the end of the line.\n\nN.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart`.",
        "nginx": "1. In a default situation, you can edit your website configuration */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default*\n\t(if you changed your site conf name */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/YOURSITECONFIGURATION*);\n2. Inside `server {...}` brackets configuration, find `ssl_protocols`;\n3. Remove `SSLv3` (if any). Make sure you have atleast another TLS protocol. If you can't find `ssl_protocols` you should be fine if your NGINX is updated.\n\n\nN.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service nginx restart`.\n"
