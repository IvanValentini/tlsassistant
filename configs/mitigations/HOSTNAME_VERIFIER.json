    "ExtendedName": "Unsecure Android HostnameVerifier",
    "Description": "By exploiting an incorrectly designed/configured HostnameVerifier, the app is vulnerable to network attacks. An attacker can potentially read transmitted data (such as login credentials), and even change the data transmitted on the HTTPS connection.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "The only acceptable mitigation is to check the related methods to fix the vulnerability or switch the app to an external TLS library (e.g. OkHttp)."
