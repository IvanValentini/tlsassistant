    "CVE": "2012-4929",
    "CVSS3": "2.6 (Low)",
    "#comment": " AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N ",
    "Description": "By exploiting the information leakage provided by DEFLATE (compression algorithm), an attacker is able to retrieve the session cookie. In particular, the attacker guesses parts of the cookie, injects them in a valid client packet and analyzes the server's response. Thanks to the properties of a DEFLATE output, if the server's response is bigger than an untouched packet, then the guess is wrong.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "Disable the TLS compression mechanism.",
      "Snippet": {
        "apache": "1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);\n2. search for the line starting with: **SSLCompression**\n   - if found, change the value to **off**;\n   - if not, add the line `SSLCompression off` within the file.\n\nN.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart`.",
        "nginx": "SSL compression is turned off by default in nginx 1.1.6+/1.0.9+ (if OpenSSL 1.0.0+ used) and nginx 1.3.2+/1.2.2+ (if older versions of OpenSSL are used).\n\n- If you are using al earlier version of nginx or OpenSSL and your distro has not backported this option then you need to \n\t1. **update to the last version** or\n\t2. recompile OpenSSL without ZLIB support."
