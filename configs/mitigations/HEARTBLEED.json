    "Description": "The TLS and DTLS implementations in <strong>OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g</strong> do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to <code>d1_both.c</code> and <code>t1_lib.c</code>, aka the Heartbleed bug.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "Update the TLS library to a safe version (e.g. OpenSSL v1.0.1g+)."
