    "Description": "The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection.",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "Using of 'static' DH ciphersuites should be completly avoided. Also reuising the same DHE secret for multiple connections should be avoided.",
