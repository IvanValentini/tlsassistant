    "Description": "By exploiting the block size of the 3DES CBC ciphers, an attacker is able to mount a birthday attack. Once the victim has (forcefully) generated the needed amount of data (approximately 2^32 blocks of data) its confidentiality can be affected due to the information leakage caused by the collisions in the cipher.\n",
    "Mitigation": {
      "Textual": "Disable support for 3DES cipher suites.",
      "Snippet": {
        "apache": "1. open your Apache configuration file (default: */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf*);\n2. find the line starting with: **SSLCipherSuite**;\n3. add the string `:!3DES` at the end.\n\nN.B. restart the server by typing: `sudo service apache2 restart`.",
